<h2>My Projects</h2>

<h3>submit</h3>

<p>submit is a web service that is intented to be used for online submission of
programming assignments. When configured, submitted projects can be
automatically assessed. submit is a significantly more sophisticated version of
<em>auto_grade</em> making it drastically simpler for students to see their feedback
and for instructors to configure their
projects. (<a href="https://github.com/ucsb-cs/submit">Source</a>, <a href="https://submit.cs.ucsb.edu">Web
service</a>)</p>

<h3>taevals</h3>

<p>taevals is a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">Google AppEngine</a> application
I wrote when I was the Lead TA to lessen the burden of completing the midterm
TA evaluations. An important factor of TA evaluations is anonymity and thus
taevals was designed with anonymity in mind. While it is easy to say an
application should be trusted, I took this one step further and made the code
available on Github under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">New BSD
License</a>. More information
about taevals can be found on its <a href="https://github.com/ucsb-cs/taevals">GitHub
page</a>.</p>

<h3>turnin_helper</h3>

<p>turnin_helper is an incredibly useful tool I wrote to assist in grading course
projects. It is intended to work in tandem with UCSB CS's turnin program. See
the project's README for everything you'll need to
know. (<a href="https://github.com/ucsb-cs/turnin_helper">Source</a>)</p>

<h4>Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>Automatic extraction of students' latest submission</li>
<li>Execute make (of any target) on extracted submissions</li>
<li>Email all students a private message about their project appended with a
generic message about the project</li>
</ul>

<h3>auto_grade</h3>

<p>I wrote auto_grade in Winter 2009 following writing turnin_helper to minimize
my effort in grading student's projects for CS160, Compilers.  Though
auto_grade reduces grading time a great deal of effort is needed at the start
of a project to define the inputs and outputs. The primary benefit of
auto_grade is that it provides immediate feedback to the students in a manor
that is completely objective. (<a href="https://github.com/ucsb-cs/auto_grade">Source</a>)</p>

<h4>Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>Immediate extraction, build, and score of student's submission</li>
<li>Scoring based on diff output and exit status codes</li>
<li>Immediate feedback to students via email which can contain information such
as number of test cases passed as well as a variable amount of diff lines</li>
<li>Option to set max running time of program</li>
<li>Ability to assign different point values for different inputs, thus
supporting extra credit inputs</li>
</ul>

<h3>CRAWL-E</h3>

<p>CRAWL-E is a web crawling framework that seamlessly supports distributed
crawling across multiple threads as well as multiple machines. I wrote CRAWL-E
in order to collect data from both <a href="https://www.overstock.com/">Overstock.com</a>
and <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> when I was working in <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/">Professor Ben
Zhao's</a> lab. For a short while after, I continued to improve
CRAWL-E as issues appear and features are requested. CRAWL-E is released under
the open source <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">New BSD
License</a>. More information
about CRAWL-E can be found along with its
<a href="https://github.com/bboe/crawl-e">source</a>.</p>
