<p><strong>Piazza</strong>: Join the class
<a href="https://piazza.com/ucsb/summer2013/cs24/home">discussion</a> on Piazza. All CS24
related questions must be asked through Piazza when not asked in-person;
emailed questions will not be answered. Snail-mailed questions require a
stamped and addressed return envelope. However, such questions will likely not
receive a timely response.</p>

<h2 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h2>

<strong>Final</strong>: Thursday August 29 12:30 - 13:50 in Phelps 2510</p>

<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>

<p>Intermediate building blocks for solving problems using computers. Topics
include data structures, object-oriented design and development, algorithms for
manipulating these data structures and their runtime analyses. Data structures
introduced include stacks, queues, lists, trees, and sets.</p>

<h3 id="required-texts">Required Texts</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>C++ Plus Data Structures</strong>, <em>5th edition</em><br />
Author: Nell Dale<br />
ISBN: 978-1449646752<br />
Links: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/books/dp/1449646751">Amazon</a>
<em>Note</em>: Previous editions of the textbook are suitable for the
class. However, you will need to be aware of any discrepancies.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>“Become a programmer” – make programming a tool, not a challenge in itself</li>
  <li>Learn how to design and implement programs using object-oriented design
principles</li>
  <li>Learn basic data structures and how to choose between them.</li>
  <li>Apply new concepts to design efficient code.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="assignments-and-grading">Assignments and Grading</h3>

<ul>
  <li>36% Projects (3 or 4 split evenly)</li>
  <li>24% Final</li>
  <li>16% Labs (8, split evenly)</li>
  <li>16% Midterm</li>
  <li>04% Homeworks (2, split evenly)</li>
  <li>04% Participation</li>
</ul>

<p>You are expected to work individually on all assignments save for the labs.</p>

<p>Participation points can be gained both through participation in class and
online, via Piazza. Additionally, participation points can be earned by being
the first student to notify me of any errors (grammar, spelling, code, etc.) on
any of the course material.</p>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<h4 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h4>

<p>All submissions are considered late when the submission log date later than the
deadline. Late submissions will be penalized <strong>one percentage point</strong> for every
<strong>five-minute</strong> interval late. The following are a few examples for clarity
assuming a deadline of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">23:59:59</code> on the previous day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A submission recorded at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00:00:00</code> will receive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">99%</code> of its assigned
score. The same is true for a submission received at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00:04:59</code>.</li>
  <li>A submission recorded at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00:45:00</code> will receive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">90%</code> of its assigned score.</li>
  <li>A submission recorded at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">04:05:00</code> will receive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">50%</code> of its assigned score.</li>
  <li>A submission recorded at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">08:15:00</code> or later following or a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">23:59:59</code>
deadline will receive a <strong>zero</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="grading-petitions">Grading Petitions</h4>

<p>Grading petitions apply only to handwritten work (includes exams). If you feel
such work was incorrectly graded, you may ask for it to be re-graded only after
the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>24 hours have passed since the work has been returned to you.</li>
  <li>You have written a clear, detailed argument in favor of your answer. In your
argument, you need to demonstrate a clear understanding of the expected
answer and compare the two.</li>
</ul>

<p>When both these conditions are met, please deliver both your written work and
written argument to the instructor.</p>

<p>Note that you needn’t follow this procedure if your answer matches the expected
answer and it was marked incorrect. In that case, you may indicate the mistake
to the instructor during office hours.</p>

<h4 id="lecture-attendance">Lecture Attendance</h4>

<p>Neither lecture, nor lab attendance is mandatory. Lecture attendance is always
strongly encouraged.</p>

<h4 id="labs">Labs</h4>

<p>Attendance at the first lab is mandatory so that you can be paired up with
another student. This pairing will persist throughout the class, and may only
be changed with instructor approval. Subsequent lab attendance is not required,
but strongly encouraged. Each lab is due by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">23:59:59</code> on the day of the
lab. Only one student in the pair needs to submit the project.</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>Students of this course are expected to support the ideal of academic integrity
as described on UCSB’s Office of Judicial Affairs
<a href="https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity">website</a>. Students
discovered to be cheating, plagiarizing or colluding will at the very least
receive a zero on the assignment and may be suspended from UCSB pending
severity.</p>

<p>Below are some examples of violations of academic integrity. Note that this
list isn’t exhaustive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Showing any portion of your code to another student</li>
  <li>Viewing any portion of another student’s code</li>
  <li>Copying another student’s work</li>
  <li>Modifying another student’s work to make it “your own”</li>
  <li>Copying or modifying anyone else’s work without attribution</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are some examples of acceptable forms of help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discussing your assignment with the Professor and TA</li>
  <li>Discussing the general details of the assignment with others</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="online-interaction">Online Interaction</h3>

<p>All announcements and online discussion will occur via
<a href="https://piazza.com/ucsb/summer2013/cs24/home">Piazza</a>. CS24 related questions
asked via email will not be answered. Personal questions or questions that
contain too much information specific to your implementation should be sent as
a <strong>private</strong> question via Piazza (see “<a href="https://piazza.com/features#">Post privately to instructors or
students</a>”).</p>

<p>You are encouraged and will be rewarded with participation points for
non-anonymously asking and responding to questions via Piazza. While you may
currently post questions or provide feedback anonymously, this feature will be
removed if it becomes abused. Finally, as a hopefully unnecessary reminder,
please be respectful to your peers when responding to questions.</p>
