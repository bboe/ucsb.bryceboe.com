## Announcements

__Piazza__: Join the class
[discussion](https://piazza.com/ucsb/summer2012/cs32) on Piazza. All CS32
related questions must be asked through Piazza when not asked in-person;
emailed questions will not be answered. Snail-mailed questions require a
stamped and addressed return envelope. However, such questions will likely not
receive a timely response.


As of July 30 the course is full. No additional students will be added to the
class at this time.



## Syllabus

### Dates and Times

__Lectures__: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday 12:30 - 13:55 in Phelps 2510  
__Labs__: Thursday 14:30 - 15:55 in ESB 1003 (Cooper Lab)  
__Final__: Wednesday August 12 12:30 - 13:55 in Phelps 2510



### Course Description

Advanced topics in object-oriented computing. Topics
include encapsulation, data hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, compilation,
linking and loading, memory management, and debugging; recent advances in
design and development tools, practices, libraries, and operating system
support.


### Required Texts

* __Problem Solving with C++__, _8th edition_  
  Author: Walter Savitch ([Wikipedia info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Savitch))
  ISBN: 9780132162739  
  Links: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0132162733/)
  _Note_: Previous editions of the textbook are suitable for the
  class. However, you will need to be aware of any discrepancies.
* __Computer Science 32 Reader__  
  Available at the Alternative Digital Printing in the UCEN  
  _Note_: The reader from spring 2012 is identical save for the cover page.


### Student Learning Outcomes

* By the end of this course, you will be able to use the shell to start
  processes in all possible input/output redirection states.
* By the end of this course, you will have designed an object-oriented project
  that demonstrates the use of templates, inheritance, polymorphism, friend
  classes and operator overloading.
* By the end of this course, you will be able to justify the selection of a
  particular sort algorithm for a given task.
* By the end of this course, you will be able to step-through the process the
  operating system performs to load a program into memory.
* By the end of this course, you will be able to identify where in a process's
  memory structure a defined variable is located.


### Assignments and Grading

* 24% Projects (2, split evenly)
* 24% Labs (5, split evenly)
* 24% Final
* 16% Midterm
* 08% Homeworks (2, split evenly)
* 04% Participation

You are expected to work individually on all assignments save for the labs.

Participation points can be gained both through participation in class and
online, via Piazza. Additionally, participation points can be earned by being
the first student to notify me of any errors (grammar, spelling, code, etc.) on
any of the course material.


### Policies

#### Late Submissions

All submissions are considered late when the submission log date (from
`turnin`) is later than the deadline. The submission log date is the time of
the CSIL server under normal-operating conditions. Late submissions will be
penalized __one percentage point__ for every __five-minute__ interval late. The
following are a few examples for clarity assuming a deadline of `23:59:59` on
the previous day:

* A submission recorded at `00:00:00` will receive `99%` of its assigned
  score. The same is true for a submission received at `00:04:59`.
* A submission recorded at `00:45:00` will receive `90%` of its assigned score.
* A submission recorded at `04:05:00` will receive `50%` of its assigned score.
* A submission recorded at `08:15:00` or later following or a `23:59:59`
  deadline will receive a __zero__.


#### Grading Petitions

Grading petitions apply only to handwritten work. If you feel such work was
incorrectly graded, you may ask for it to be re-graded only after the following
conditions are met:

* 24 hours have passed since the work has been returned to you.
* You have written a clear, detailed argument in favor of your answer. In your
  argument, you need to demonstrate a clear understanding of the expected answer
  and compare the two.

When both these conditions are met, please deliver both your written work and
written argument to the instructor.

Note that you needn't follow this procedure if your answer matches the expected
answer and it was marked incorrect. In that case, you may indicate the mistake
to the instructor during office hours.

#### Lecture Attendance

Lecture attendance is not mandatory but always encouraged.

#### Labs

Attendance at the first lab is mandatory so that you can be paired up with
another student. This pairing will persist throughout the class, and may only
be changed with instructor approval. Subsequent lab attendance is not required,
but strongly encouraged. Each lab is due by `23:59:59` on the day of the
lab. Only one student in the pair needs to submit the project.


### Academic Integrity

Students of this course are expected to support the ideal of academic integrity
as described on UCSB's Office of Judicial Affairs
[website](https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity). Students
discovered to be cheating, plagiarizing or colluding will at the very least
receive a zero on the assignment and may be suspended from UCSB pending
severity.

Below are some examples of violations of academic integrity. Note that this
list isn't exhaustive:

* Showing any portion of your code to another student
* Viewing any portion of another student's code
* Copying another student's work
* Modifying another student's work to make it "your own"
* Copying or modifying anyone else's work without attribution

The following are some examples of acceptable forms of help:

* Discussing your assignment with the Professor and TA
* Discussing the general details of the assignment with others


### Online Interaction

All announcements and online discussion will occur via
[Piazza](https://piazza.com/class#summer2012/cs32). CS32 related questions
asked via email will not be answered. Personal questions or questions that
contain too much information specific to your implementation should
be sent as a __private__ question via Piazza (see "[Ask questions privately to
instructors](https://piazza.com/features#)").

You are encouraged and will be rewarded with participation points for
non-anonymously asking and responding to questions via Piazza. While you may
currently post questions or provide feedback anonymously, this feature will be
removed if it becomes abused. Finally, as a hopefully unnecessary reminder,
please be respectful to your peers when responding to questions.


### Excluded Topics

Given that this course is normally taught in 10 weeks instead of 6 weeks, there
are a number of topics that won't be covered. It is strongly encouraged that
you familiarize yourself with this material in order to be on par with students
who take CS32 in other quarters.

We are skipping the following sections in the reader:

* Unix Programming Tools
* Program Building
* Libraries

Similarly, we are skipping chapter 18, _The Standard Template
Library_, in the textbook.

The following chapters from the textbook are skipped because they should mostly
be review from CS16 and CS24:

* Chapters 1-9, Basic programing concepts
* Chapter 13, _Pointers and Linked Lists_
* Chapter 14, _Recursion_

Finally, chapter 12, _Separate Compilation and Namespaces_, and chapter 16,
_Exception Handling_, are not typically covered in this class; therefore, we
are also excluding them.
