## Homework 2, Sorting Algorithms

### Motivation

The goal of this assignment is to encourage you to become a master of a sorting
algorithm. While many languages have built-in methods for sorting, as a
Computer Scientist in training (or simply someone taking CS32) there is no
excuse for not knowing how to properly implement at least one sorting
algorithm.

### The Algorithms

You will be assigned to report on one of the following five sort algorithms:

* [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
* [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
* [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
* [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* [Heapsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)

Please check Piazza for your algorithm assignment.

### Mini-lecture slides

For this homework you are to prepare the slides that would accompany a
mini-lecture with a duration of 10 to 20 minutes. The goal of the mini-lecture
is to teach our class all there is to know about the sorting algorithm you have
been assigned.

Your lecture slides must address each of the following:

 * How does the algorithm work? Please provide at least two examples to help
   explain the procedure.
 * What is the running time of the algorithm (best case, average case, worst
   case)? You should be able to explain why the running time is as it is.
 * Are there any special cases that would make the algorithm _more_ efficient?
   Explain.
 * Are there any special cases that would make the algorithm _less_ efficient?
   Explain.
 * Does the algorithm depend on any data structures (aside from the list or
   array the data may already be stored in)? Explain
 * Can the algorithm run in-place, that is, without the need of extra memory?

### Teaching the class

If you would like to volunteer to deliver your mini-lecture, you may request
to do so via Piazza. One volunteer for each sorting algorithm will be selected
to teach the class. If there are no volunteers, someone will be selected at
random.

Therefore, if you plan to attend Monday's lecture (highly recommended), be
prepared to give your mini-lecture. You should be prepared even if someone
volunteered for your algorithm, as that student may not show up.

### Collaboration

For this assignment you are encouraged to collaborate with the other students
in the class. Feel free to use Piazza to discuss all the information required
in your slides. You may not, however, share your lecture slides; please keep
those private until the submission deadline has passed.

### External Resources

In your slides, please feel free to use external resources. However, ensure you
provide proper attribution to any work you include. Citing the wikipedia
article is not sufficient, dig deeper to discover the actual source. If you
aren't sure how to provide a proper attribution for something, please ask on
Piazza.

Additionally, linking to external resources from within your slides is strongly
encouraged as there are a number of excellent sorting algorithm resources
online.

### Submission

Please submit your material by 10:59:59 Monday morning (08/06) using
submit. Rename the file containing your slides to one of the following names;
whichever is appropriate for your filetype:

 * cs32_sorting.pdf
 * cs32_sorting.ppt
 * cs32_sorting.pptx

Submit via:

    ~cs32/submit hw2@cs32 cs32_sorting.{EXT}

Replace `{EXT}` with whatever the extension is of your file.
