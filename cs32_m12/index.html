<p><strong>Piazza</strong>: Join the class
<a href="https://piazza.com/ucsb/summer2012/cs32">discussion</a> on Piazza. All CS32
related questions must be asked through Piazza when not asked in-person;
emailed questions will not be answered. Snail-mailed questions require a
stamped and addressed return envelope. However, such questions will likely not
receive a timely response.</p>

<p>As of July 30 the course is full. No additional students will be added to the
class at this time.</p>

<h2 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h2>

</ul>

<h3 id="student-learning-outcomes">Student Learning Outcomes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>By the end of this course, you will be able to use the shell to start
processes in all possible input/output redirection states.</li>
  <li>By the end of this course, you will have designed an object-oriented project
that demonstrates the use of templates, inheritance, polymorphism, friend
classes and operator overloading.</li>
  <li>By the end of this course, you will be able to justify the selection of a
particular sort algorithm for a given task.</li>
  <li>By the end of this course, you will be able to step-through the process the
operating system performs to load a program into memory.</li>
  <li>By the end of this course, you will be able to identify where in a process’s
memory structure a defined variable is located.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="assignments-and-grading">Assignments and Grading</h3>

<ul>
  <li>24% Projects (2, split evenly)</li>
  <li>24% Labs (5, split evenly)</li>
  <li>24% Final</li>
  <li>16% Midterm</li>
  <li>08% Homeworks (2, split evenly)</li>
  <li>04% Participation</li>
</ul>

<p>You are expected to work individually on all assignments save for the labs.</p>

<p>Participation points can be gained both through participation in class and
online, via Piazza. Additionally, participation points can be earned by being
the first student to notify me of any errors (grammar, spelling, code, etc.) on
any of the course material.</p>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<h4 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h4>

<p>All submissions are considered late when the submission log date (from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">turnin</code>) is later than the deadline. The submission log date is the time of
the CSIL server under normal-operating conditions. Late submissions will be
penalized <strong>one percentage point</strong> for every <strong>five-minute</strong> interval late. The
following are a few examples for clarity assuming a deadline of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">23:59:59</code> on
the previous day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A submission recorded at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00:00:00</code> will receive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">99%</code> of its assigned
score. The same is true for a submission received at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00:04:59</code>.</li>
  <li>A submission recorded at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00:45:00</code> will receive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">90%</code> of its assigned score.</li>
  <li>A submission recorded at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">04:05:00</code> will receive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">50%</code> of its assigned score.</li>
  <li>A submission recorded at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">08:15:00</code> or later following or a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">23:59:59</code>
deadline will receive a <strong>zero</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="grading-petitions">Grading Petitions</h4>

<p>Grading petitions apply only to handwritten work. If you feel such work was
incorrectly graded, you may ask for it to be re-graded only after the following
conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>24 hours have passed since the work has been returned to you.</li>
  <li>You have written a clear, detailed argument in favor of your answer. In your
argument, you need to demonstrate a clear understanding of the expected answer
and compare the two.</li>
</ul>

<p>When both these conditions are met, please deliver both your written work and
written argument to the instructor.</p>

<p>Note that you needn’t follow this procedure if your answer matches the expected
answer and it was marked incorrect. In that case, you may indicate the mistake
to the instructor during office hours.</p>

<h4 id="lecture-attendance">Lecture Attendance</h4>

<p>Lecture attendance is not mandatory but always encouraged.</p>

<h4 id="labs">Labs</h4>

<p>Attendance at the first lab is mandatory so that you can be paired up with
another student. This pairing will persist throughout the class, and may only
be changed with instructor approval. Subsequent lab attendance is not required,
but strongly encouraged. Each lab is due by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">23:59:59</code> on the day of the
lab. Only one student in the pair needs to submit the project.</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>Students of this course are expected to support the ideal of academic integrity
as described on UCSB’s Office of Judicial Affairs
<a href="https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity">website</a>. Students
discovered to be cheating, plagiarizing or colluding will at the very least
receive a zero on the assignment and may be suspended from UCSB pending
severity.</p>

<p>Below are some examples of violations of academic integrity. Note that this
list isn’t exhaustive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Showing any portion of your code to another student</li>
  <li>Viewing any portion of another student’s code</li>
  <li>Copying another student’s work</li>
  <li>Modifying another student’s work to make it “your own”</li>
  <li>Copying or modifying anyone else’s work without attribution</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are some examples of acceptable forms of help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discussing your assignment with the Professor and TA</li>
  <li>Discussing the general details of the assignment with others</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="online-interaction">Online Interaction</h3>

<p>All announcements and online discussion will occur via
<a href="https://piazza.com/class#summer2012/cs32">Piazza</a>. CS32 related questions
asked via email will not be answered. Personal questions or questions that
contain too much information specific to your implementation should
be sent as a <strong>private</strong> question via Piazza (see
“<a href="https://piazza.com/features#">Ask questions privately to instructors</a>”).</p>

<p>You are encouraged and will be rewarded with participation points for
non-anonymously asking and responding to questions via Piazza. While you may
currently post questions or provide feedback anonymously, this feature will be
removed if it becomes abused. Finally, as a hopefully unnecessary reminder,
please be respectful to your peers when responding to questions.</p>

<h3 id="excluded-topics">Excluded Topics</h3>

<p>Given that this course is normally taught in 10 weeks instead of 6 weeks, there
are a number of topics that won’t be covered. It is strongly encouraged that
you familiarize yourself with this material in order to be on par with students
who take CS32 in other quarters.</p>

<p>We are skipping the following sections in the reader:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unix Programming Tools</li>
  <li>Program Building</li>
  <li>Libraries</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, we are skipping chapter 18, <em>The Standard Template
Library</em>, in the textbook.</p>

<p>The following chapters from the textbook are skipped because they should mostly
be review from CS16 and CS24:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chapters 1-9, Basic programing concepts</li>
  <li>Chapter 13, <em>Pointers and Linked Lists</em></li>
  <li>Chapter 14, <em>Recursion</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, chapter 12, <em>Separate Compilation and Namespaces</em>, and chapter 16,
<em>Exception Handling</em>, are not typically covered in this class; therefore, we
are also excluding them.</p>
