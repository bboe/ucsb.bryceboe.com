<a id="teaching_assistant"></a><h3>Teaching Assistant Experience</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Winter 2014 -- Problem Solving with Computers II (CS24)</dt>
  <dt>Winter 2012 -- Problem Solving with Computers II (CS24)</dt>
  <dd>Adapted my automated feedback and assessment system to provide
    supplemental feedback crucial to first year students' success.<br/>
    <strong>Student Evaluations</strong> -- 24 responses (1-5, 1 is best)<br/>
    Overall evaluation of the TA: 1.3 (cs department average: 1.6)<br/>
  </dd>
  <dt>2011-2012 Academic Year -- Computer Science Lead TA</dt>
  <dd>Participated in the
    2011 Lead TA
    Institute. Responsible for training first year teaching assistants in
    the fall through the CS501 seminar covering topics such as confidence in
    the classroom, grading, ethics, and teaching pedagogy. Additionally
    responsible for providing TA consulting, and ensuring all new TAs are video
    taped and attend a video consultation in the winter quarter. Finally each
    quarter I conducted midterm TA evaluations for all the courses.<br/>
    Notable additions to the TA training program include the addition of a TA
    pairing program in which students of CS501 had to attend a current TAs
    laboratory, or discussion section as well as requiring CS501 students to
    create a Teaching Philosophy statement.<br/></dd>
  <dt>Spring 2011 -- Operating Systems (CS170)</dt>
  <dd>An upper division course required for both Computer Science and Computer
    Engineering majors with 52 students. The projects were similar to when I
    taught the class in Spring 2009.<br/>  I was responsible for teaching one
    project oriented section a week and handling half the project grading.<br/>
    <strong>Student Evaluations</strong> -- 10 responses (1-5, 1 is best)<br/>
    Overall evaluation of the TA: 1.4 (cs department average: 1.6)<br/>
  </dd>
  <dt>2009-2010 Academic Year -- Computer Science Lead TA</dt>
  <dd>Participated in the 2011
    2009 Lead TA
    Institute. Responsible for training first year teaching assistants in
    the fall through the CS501 seminar covering topics such as confidence in
    the classroom, grading, ethics, and teaching pedagogy. Additionally
    responsible for providing TA consulting, and ensuring all new TAs are video
    taped and attend a video consultation in the winter quarter. Finally each
    quarter I conducted midterm TA evaluations for all the courses. In attempt
    to make the midterm TA evaluation process more efficient I implemented an
    online system,
  <a href="{{ "/projects#taevals" | relative_url }}">taevals</a>, which I launched in the
  spring quarter.</dd>
  <dt>Spring 2009 -- Operating Systems (CS170)</dt>
  <dd>An upper division course required for both Computer Science and Computer
    Engineering majors with 42 students. The projects involved writing a user
    level shell for Linux, adding real-time processes to the Minix scheduler,
    adding a semaphore server (service) to Minix, implementing the core dump
    functionality in Minix and finally adding immediate files to Minix's file
    system.<br/>  As the sole TA, I was responsible for teaching one project
    oriented section a week, in addition to handling the grading of the
    projects. Additionally I presented the lecture on memory management.
    <br/>
    <strong>Student Evaluations</strong> -- 32 responses (1-5, 1 is best)<br/>
    Overall evaluation of the TA: 1.3 (cs department average: 1.8)<br/>
  </dd>
  <dt>Winter 2009 -- Compilers (CS160)</dt>
  <dd>An upper division course required for Computer Science majors with 25
    students. The projects had the students write a recursive decent parser for
    a calculator, followed by a much larger project where the students wrote
    a compiler for a language similar to C utilizing the tools flex and bison.
    The assembly produced by their compiler was for x86 machines.<br/>
    I instructed one section a week, and graded 5 projects. During the course I
    wrote both a simple utility,
    <a href="{{ "/projects#turnin_helper" | relative_url }}">turnin_helper</a>
    and a more sophisticated automatic grading utility,
    <a href="{{ "/projects#auto_grade" | relative_url }}">auto_grade</a> to reduce the
    time spent grading. The latter utility was tremendously beneficial to the
    students as they received immediate feedback for their submitted projects.
    <br/>
    <strong>Student Evaluations</strong> -- 10 responses (1-5, 1 is best)<br/>
    Overall evaluation of TA: 1.1 (cs department average: 1.9)<br/>

  <dt>November 2012, Programming Competition Teams' Coach</dt>
  <dd>Identical responsibilities to those lised under the November 2011
    description.</dd>
  <dt>Summer 2012, Animal Tlatoque</dt>
  <dd><a href="https://discover.cs.ucsb.edu/research/animaltlatoque/">Animal Tlatoque</a>
    was a two-week, NSF funded, summer camp targeted towards middle school
    students that incorporates Latin American Culture, animals and computer
    science. As the graduate student organizer I was responsible for refining
    the scratch-based activities and ensuring the undergraduates' day-to-day
    preparation.</dd>
  <dt>November 2011, Programming Competition Teams' Coach</dt>
  <dd>As the coach for the three UCSB teams competing in
    the <a href="http://socalcontest.org/">2011 Southern
    California Region ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest</a>, I
    was primarily responsible for ensuring the teams' preparation on the day of
    the competition. This task involved ensuring they were familiar with the
    official submission process as well as the process for asking for any
    needed clarifications. Additionally I was responsible for transporting the
    majority of the UCSB student participants between Santa Barbara and
    Riverside for the competition.</dd>
  <dt>February 2011, FUSE
    (Family Ultimate Science Exploration) Volunteer</dt>
  <dd>As a FUSE volunteer, I was tasked with leading the
    <a href="{{ "/public/FUSEII_Speakers.pdf" | relative_url }}">Homemade Speakers</a>
    activity. In addition to experiment preparation and providing a general
    overview of the activity, I assisted the three groups of fifteen to twenty
    middle school students (plus their parents) in the construction of a
    speaker. I took great delight in observing the students' awe when they
    first heard music from their paper plate speakers.</dd>

<h3>Open Source Projects</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>CRAWL-E (<a href="https://github.com/bboe/crawl-e">source</a>)</dt>
  <dd>CRAWL-E is a web crawling framework that seamlessly supports distributed
    crawling across multiple threads as well as multiple machines. One of the
    primary advantages of CRAWL-E over other distributed crawlers is its
    continued use of a single socket to perform many HTTP requests thus
    drastically reducing the number of TCP handshakes required. I wrote CRAWL-E
    in order to collect data from both Overstock.com and Facebook when I was
    working in Professor Ben Zhao's lab. Since that time, I have continued to
    improve CRAWL-E as issues appear and features are requested.</dd>
  <dt>Python Reddit API Wrapper
    (<a href="https://github.com/praw-dev/praw">source</a>)</dt>
  <dd>The Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) is python library that interfaces
    with the API provided the the social news
    site <a href="https://reddit.com">reddit</a>. PRAW has been installed
    well over <a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/praw">a million
    times</a> and is <em>starred</em> on github by
    over <a href="https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/stargazers">2800
    developers</a>. As the package maintainer and primary developer I regularly
    monitor reddit's source code for changes in order to add support for new
    API functionality when available. I also often communicate with users of
    PRAW to get a sense of what may be lacking or could use improvement. As a
    result of such communications I have
    <a href="https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/commits/master?author=bboe">personally
    contributed</a> a number of improvements to reddit's source. These
    improvements in turn lead to improvements in PRAW's source.</dd>
