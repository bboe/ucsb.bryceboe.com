<dt>Results:
<dd>Congratulations to Ex-2300s (Alexander Kuo and Colin Langton) for winning the UCSB Programming Battle. Coming in a close second was Lord Macgyver (Bryan Donyanavard and Marc Mendonca). The full results will be posted in the near future as well as pictures of the event.<br/>
If you would like to download and run everything for yourself grab <a href="/public/CodeRuler.tar.gz">CodeRuler.tar.gz</a>.
</dd>
</dt>

<dt>Highlights:
<dd>The battle is Tuesday April 8th!<br/>
Check-in starts at 4:45pm, we should be getting started at 5:00pm.<br/>
The contest is in <strong>csil</strong> and will go until 10:00pm.<br/>
We will have <strong>pizza</strong> and a big projector for watching the battles.<br/>
Students can compete as individuals or teams of two or three people. We can try to match you up if you don't already have a partner.<br/>
The language is Java, and you can bring any references you like, however note that you will only have web access to the Java API.</dd>
</dt>

<dt>Registration:
<dd>To register please send an email to Bryce (bboe (at) cs (dot) ucsb (dot) edu) with  the names and CS account names of those on your team as well as a desired team name. Please send this information prior to the morning of Tuesday, April 8. Late registrations, and drop-ins are fine, but we can't guarantee pizza for everyone if we don't know how many people are participating.</dd>
</dt>

<dt>What is the UCSB Programming Battle?
<dd>Each team will program up a software bot to compete head to head with the other teams.  The specific environment and type of bot will be kept secret until the start of the contest. You will be given an API to move your bot around in the environment along with other capabilities. You will use this API to score points and complete objectives in direct competition with the other teams' bots.  Your program will be able to see the other bots and make strategic and tactical decisions without any human input.  To compete, your team must succeed at building a basic bot. But to win, your team's strategy must be superior to that of your opponents. The technical part is easy. But, your opponents will make sure that the real challenge will be in inventing and coding a winning strategy!</dd>
</dt>

<dt>How will the winners be determined?
<dd>The contest is in two parts. The first part is the coding portion. This will start at 5:00pm and end at 10:00pm. As you code, you can test your bot in a "private simulation" or compete live with other teams' bots, all the while munching on some pizza. At the end of the competition, you will submit your bot to compete in the main competition -- a tournament to determine the winners. Your team will watch the final tournament rounds on a big projector and we will likely have google t-shirts/pens/stuff and maybe even some prizes for the winning team.</dd>
</dt>

<dt>Eligibility:
<dd>You must be a part time or a full time UCSB student with an active CS account.  All undergraduates and BS/MS students are free to participate.  We will likely award a first place to both the best undergraduate and the best BS/MS student teams.</dd>
</dt>

<dt>Goals:
<dd>The only goal of this contest is to have fun and beat up on some of your friends' bots.</dd>
